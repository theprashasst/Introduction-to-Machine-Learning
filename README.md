# Introduction to Machine Learning with Fast.ai

Welcome to the **Introduction to Machine Learning with Fast.ai** repository! This repository is dedicated to my journey through the Fast.ai course, where I will be learning and implementing various machine learning techniques using the Fast.ai library. This repository will serve as a collection of my notes, code exercises, and project implementations as I progress through the course.

## Repository Structure

- **Notebooks**: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for each lesson, complete with code, explanations, and exercises.
- **Datasets**: Sample datasets used for practice and projects. (Note: Large datasets might be linked or referenced instead of stored directly in the repository.)
- **Projects**: End-to-end projects applying the concepts learned in the course to real-world datasets.
- **Notes**: Detailed notes and summaries of key concepts from each lesson.
- **Scripts**: Python scripts for various utility functions and experiments.

## Course Overview

The Fast.ai course is designed to provide a practical, hands-on introduction to machine learning. It covers a wide range of topics, including:

- Introduction to machine learning concepts
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Model training and evaluation
- Feature engineering
- Advanced techniques like ensembling and model interpretation
